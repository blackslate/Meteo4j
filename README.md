# Meteo4j

A barebones demo of how to use a Neo4j graph database in a Meteor project.

The demo uses the [Neo4j Reactivity driver for Meteor](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/ostrio-Neo4jreactivity) by [Dmitriy Aristarkhovich](https://github.com/dr-dimitru). You will also need to install Neo4j and its npm package, Node.js and Meteor.

For full details, please see the [Meteo4j site on GitHub](http://lexogram.github.io/Meteo4j/).
